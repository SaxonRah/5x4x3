To calculate coil sizes for your **5x4x3 axial flux motor design**, we need to consider several parameters, including:

1. **Motor Specifications**:
   - Number of stators: **5**
   - Number of rotors: **4**
   - Number of motors: **3**
   - Outer diameter (OD) and inner diameter (ID) of the stator
   - Desired operating voltage, current, and power

2. **Electromagnetic Considerations**:
   - Desired torque
   - Magnetic flux density
   - Air gap size

3. **Coil Parameters**:
   - Number of turns per coil
   - Wire diameter
   - Slot fill factor (typically ~70% for high-efficiency motors)
   - Total copper volume

---

### **1. Determine Dimensions of the Stator and Coil Slots**

The exact size of the coils depends on the dimensions of the stator. Let:
- **Outer diameter (OD):** $D_{out}$
- **Inner diameter (ID):** $D_{in}$
- **Stator height:** $h_{stator}$

The coil area is determined by the available space in the stator slots. For a single stator:

```math
A_{coil} = \frac{\pi}{4} \left( D_{out}^2 - D_{in}^2 \right) \times \frac{1}{N_{slots}}
```
Where $N_{slots}$ is the number of slots per stator.

---

### **2. Magnetic Flux and Number of Turns**

The number of turns $N$ depends on the magnetic flux $\Phi$ through the stator and the desired back EMF $E$:

```math
E = N \cdot \Phi \cdot f
```
Where:
- $E$ = Voltage per coil
- $\Phi$ = Magnetic flux through the stator (depends on rotor magnets and air gap)
- $f$ = Frequency of operation (based on motor speed and pole pairs)

Solve for $N$:

```math
N = \frac{E}{\Phi \cdot f}
```

---

### **3. Wire Gauge and Slot Fill**

The wire diameter depends on:
1. **Current through the coil $I$:**
   
```math
   A_{wire} = \frac{I}{J}
```
   Where $J$ is the current density (e.g., $5-10 , A/mm^2$).

2. **Slot fill factor $k_{fill}$:**
   
```math
   k_{fill} = \frac{N \cdot A_{wire}}{A_{slot}}
```
   $A_{slot}$ is the area available for the wire in each stator slot.

---

### **4. Total Copper Volume**

The total copper volume for one stator:

```math
V_{copper} = N \cdot l_{coil} \cdot A_{wire}
```
Where:
- $l_{coil}$ = Average length of one coil turn (depends on stator OD and ID)

For all stators in the 5x4x3 design:

```math
V_{copper, total} = 5 \cdot 3 \cdot V_{copper}
```

---

### **5. Practical Example**

Assume the following:
- **Outer diameter $D_{out} = 200 \, \text{mm}$**
- **Inner diameter $D_{in} = 100 \, \text{mm}$**
- **Stator height $h_{stator} = 10 \, \text{mm}$**
- **Slots per stator $N_{slots} = 12$**
- **Voltage $E = 48 \, \text{V}$**
- **Frequency $f = 100 \, \text{Hz}$**
- **Magnetic flux $\Phi = 0.005 \, \text{Wb}$**

#### Coil Area

```math
A_{coil} = \frac{\pi}{4} \left( 200^2 - 100^2 \right) \cdot \frac{1}{12} \cdot 10^{-6} \approx 785.4 \, \text{mm}^2
```

#### Number of Turns

```math
N = \frac{48}{0.005 \cdot 100} = 96
```

#### Wire Area
For $I = 10 \, \text{A}$ and $J = 7 \, \text{A/mm}^2 $:

```math
A_{wire} = \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.43 \, \text{mm}^2
```

Using $A_{slot} = 785.4 \, \text{mm}^2$ and $k_{fill} = 0.7$:

```math
N \cdot A_{wire} = 96 \cdot 1.43 \approx 137 \, \text{mm}^2
```
This satisfies the slot fill requirement.

#### Copper Volume
For $l_{coil} = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot (D_{out} + D_{in}) \approx 471 \, \text{mm}$:

```math
V_{copper} = 96 \cdot 471 \cdot 1.43 \approx 64,540 \, \text{mm}^3
```

For the entire system:

```math
V_{copper, total} = 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 64,540 \approx 968,100 \, \text{mm}^3
```
